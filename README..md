# Beekeeper Challenge Back end

This is the back end repo of my beekeeper challenge.

## Technologies

- Node
- TypeScript
- Express
- Mongoose

[See the front end project here](https://github.com/TomWilson89/auth-boilerplate-front)

I'm hosting this with a free dyno in Heroku, so the performance is quite bad right now.
But you can take a look [here](https://front-ohoney.herokuapp.com/)
